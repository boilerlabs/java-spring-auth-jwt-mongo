## Features
- JWT authentication for secure token-based access
- RSA keys for signing and verifying JWTs
- Role-based access control
- Configured SecurityFilterChain for managing security
- Password hashing for secure storage
- User Sign Up and Sign In endpoints
- Profile endpoint for accessing user details

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- Maven

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/boboilerlabs/java-spring-auth-jwt-mongo
cd java-spring-auth-jwt-mongo
```

2. Generating `app.key` and `app.pub`:
```bash
openssl genrsa -out src/main/resources/app.key 2048 
openssl rsa -in src/main/resources/app.key -pubout -out src/main/resources/app.pub
```

3. Running with Maven
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Usage

### Sign Up
To sign up, send a POST request to `/api/auth/signup` with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
    "username": "example_username",
    "password": "example_password"
}
```

### Sign In

To sign in, send a POST request to `/api/auth/signin` with the following JSON payload

```json
{
    "username": "example_username",
    "password": "example_password"
}
```

The response will contain the JWT token

```json
{
    "token": "example_token",
    "expiration": "2024-09-19T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Accessing Protected Routes

To access a protected route, include the JWT token in the Authorization header

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/profile \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer example_token"
```

The response will return the user details:

```bash
{
    "id": "user-uuid",
    "username": "user",
    "roles": ["ROLE_USER"]
}
```
